# Welcome!

Thank you for visiting Every Voice Engaged.  We are in the process of getting our project more accessable for public visability and contributions.  

Check out [CGA_tech_stack.pdf](https://github.com/EveryVoiceEngaged/Welcome/blob/master/CGA%20tech%20stack.pdf) for a pictorial view of our tech stack.

At this time our code repository remains private.  If you're interested in helping out, reach out to gary@everyvoiceengaged.org and let's start a conversation.  After that we can add you to our private repo and we can start working together.
