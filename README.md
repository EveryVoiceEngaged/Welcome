# Welcome!

Thank you for visiting Every Voice Engaged.  We are in the process of getting our project more accessable for public visability and contributions.  

The backend of our app is written in Scala and runs on the Lift framework.  The frontend code is currently running on Angular JS. 

At this time our code repository remains private.  If you're interested in helping out, reach out to gary@everyvoiceengaged.org and let's start a conversation.  After that we can add you to our private repo and we can start working together.

## Requirements
1. Install JDK version 1.8
2. Install Maven
3. Install PostgreSQL 10.x
4. Create a database called "cga_dev" (`createdb cga_dev`)
